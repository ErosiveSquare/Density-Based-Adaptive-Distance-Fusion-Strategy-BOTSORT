# Density-Based-Adaptive-Distance-Fusion-Strategy-BOTSORT

Due to the potential misguidance of tracking results by motion-based methods such as Kalman filtering in scenarios with overlapping and intersecting targets,I would like to estimate target density by assigning kernel functions to detection boxes,thereby adjusting the weights of appearance cost and motion cost.

In the MOT17 dataset,the YOLOv8m model without fine-tuning performs slightly better than the baseline.However,after fine-tuning,the performance deteriorates.
The project started on February 2,2025,and was put on hold on March 2,2025.
